    <ul>
    <li>Cats are believed to be the only mammals who don’t taste sweetness.</li>
    <li>Cats are nearsighted, but their peripheral vision and night vision are much better than that of humans.</li>
    <li>Cats are supposed to have 18 toes (five toes on each front paw; four toes on each back paw).</li>
    <li>Cats can jump up to six times their length.</li>
    <li>Cats’ claws all curve downward, which means that they can’t climb down trees head-first. Instead, they have to back down the trunk.</li>
    <li>Cats’ collarbones don’t connect to their other bones, as these bones are buried in their shoulder muscles.</li>
    <li>Cats have 230 bones, while humans only have 206.</li>
    <li>Cats have an extra organ that allows them to taste scents on the air, which is why your cat stares at you with her mouth open from time to time.</li>
    <li>Cats have whiskers on the backs of their front legs, as well.</li>
    <li>Cats have nearly twice the amount of neurons in their cerebral cortex as dogs.</li>
    <li>Cats have the largest eyes relative to their head size of any mammal.</li>
    <li>Cats make very little noise when they walk around. The thick, soft pads on their paws allow them to sneak up on their prey — or you!</li>
    <li>Cats’ rough tongues can lick a bone clean of any shred of meat.</li>
    <li>Cats use their long tails to balance themselves when they’re jumping or walking along narrow ledges.</li>
    <li>Cats use their whiskers to “feel” the world around them in an effort to determine which small spaces they can fit into. A cat’s whiskers are generally about the same width as its body. (This is why you should never, EVER cut their whiskers.)</li>
    <li>Cats walk like camels and giraffes: They move both of their right feet first, then move both of their left feet. No other animals walk this way.</li>
    <li>Male cats are more likely to be left-pawed, while female cats are more likely to be right-pawed.</li>
    <li>Though cats can notice the fast movements of their prey, it often seems to them that slow-moving objects are actually stagnant.</li>
    <li>Some cats are ambidextrous, but 40 percent are either left- or right-pawed.</li>
    <li>Some cats can swim.</li>
    <li>There are cats who have more than 18 toes. These extra-digit felines are referred to as being “polydactyl.”</li>
    </ul>
